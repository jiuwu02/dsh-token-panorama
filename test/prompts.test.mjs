/**
 * The default instructions: one shape, three engines.
 *
 * All three prompts are shipped defaults a user can replace in the settings
 * dialog, so the properties worth pinning are the ones the code depends on:
 * every prompt opens with the five modules in the same order (they sit on three
 * separate settings tabs but share one skeleton, so a drifting heading breaks
 * the parallel the user sees when switching between them), and each keeps the
 * one clause its call site relies on.
 *
 * The optimizer clause matters most. Its output is written straight into the
 * user's input box, and `stripFence` only removes a fence that wraps the WHOLE
 * answer — so a prompt that asks for a code block plus trailing advice leaves
 * that advice in the draft. That is why the default forbids both.
