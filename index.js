/**
 * dsh-token-panorama — Host half.
 *
 * Reads every stored session's event log through the `sessionPersistence`
 * service, folds the `usage` carried by each `assistant/message` event into
 * hourly, per-model slots, keeps the result in a revision-keyed local cache,
 * prices those slots against the configured billing rules, and serves the
 * result to the Client half over a fenced HTTP route.
 *
 * The session log is the only source of truth: the cache is a derived read
 * model whose entries are invalidated by the persistence service's own opaque
 * `revision` token, so an append only costs a re-read of the session that
 * changed.
 *
 * The modules under `lib/` split the work by concern: time math, event
 * folding, the config schema, billing, the cache, and the HTTP primitives. This
 * file only wires them to the plugin lifecycle.
