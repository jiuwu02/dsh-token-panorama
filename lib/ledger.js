/**
 * The tool self-consumption ledger: what the plugin's own LLM calls cost.
 *
 * Compaction and prompt optimization are direct LLM calls whose tokens never
 * appear in any session log, so without this ledger the panorama would show a
 * bill that is quietly missing a line. Every call appends one JSONL record to
 * the plugin storage directory, and the summary route folds the ledger into
 * the snapshot as a separately labelled source — the two sources are shown
 * side by side rather than silently merged into the session totals.
 *
 * Appends are fire-and-forget by design: an accounting write must never fail
 * the operation it is accounting for. Reads happen on snapshot builds only.
