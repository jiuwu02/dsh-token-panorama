/**
 * The durable usage fold, contributed to the Host's projection registry.
 *
 * The panel's cache can be thrown away — a version bump, a corrupt file, a
 * deleted profile — and rebuilding it means inflating every stored log. The
 * Host already runs a registry that folds every committed session event once,
 * while the events are still in memory, and a companion service persists those
 * states to disk. Contributing the same fold here makes the work survive the
 * panel's own cache: a scan can seed from a session's stored projection and
 * only read the frames appended after its watermark, and a session the Host
 * has just written needs no log read at all.
 *
 * The unit's state is deliberately the panel's own slot shape rather than a
 * second model of the same numbers: one definition of billable usage means a
 * seeded fold and a freshly folded one can never disagree about what a row
 * means.
