 * Fold one session's events into hourly, per-model slots plus the session's own
 * title. A slot row is `[hourKey, model, input, output, cacheRead, cacheWrite,
 * total, calls]`; every later dimension (day, model, price band) is derived
 * from those rows, so the cache stores each event exactly once.
 * The last sequence number seen is reported alongside the rows: an incremental
 * pass resumes the log from the frame that carries it, and only the fold itself
 * knows how far the events it was handed actually reached.
 * @param events - the session's committed event log.
 * @param timeZone - the zone that decides the slot boundary.
 * @returns the slot rows, the session's latest title, and the highest sequence
 *   number folded (-1 when the slice carried none).
